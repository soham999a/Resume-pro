# Resume-pro
As someone who's gone through resume struggles myself, I wanted to create a tool that’s actually helpful. Not another generic checker.
 So I combined my skills in web dev + AI to build something smarter, more visual, and more personal.
🛠️ What it does:
Analyzes your resume using AI (Google Gemini)
Gives real feedback: ATS compatibility, impact, keywords, and readability
Generates job recommendations based on your skills
Suggests a personalized LinkedIn bio
Shows an industry match %
Visualizes your future career path (timeline!)
Identifies skill gaps to help you grow
🌐 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js (for stunning 3D visuals)
Backend: Python with Flask (all API logic)
AI: Google Gemini API (resume parsing & feedback)
Deployment: Vercel
😅 Challenges I faced:
Getting Gemini to understand real-world resumes wasn't easy — lots of prompt tweaking and edge case handling.
Three.js was wild at first — spent hours fixing broken visuals and making sure it runs smoothly on all devices.
Balancing AI accuracy with performance took time, especially making the API responses fast enough.
And yes — debugging Flask API routes at 2am isn’t as glamorous as it sounds 😅
🎯 What I learned:
Prompt engineering is a skill of its own.
Users need clarity > complexity.
A great UX comes from frustration + iteration.
Full-stack means wearing 10 hats — but it’s so worth it when you see the final thing live.
